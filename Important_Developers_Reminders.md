If styles do not update, Although it does, it has been tested, Just Incase:

```txt
Ctrl + F5
```

# Important Frontend Notes

```txt
app/static/css/output.css

# Backend Development

## Flask-Migrate Commands

If you change database models:

- add table
- add column
- remove column
- modify field type

then create a migration:

```bash
docker compose exec web flask db migrate -m "describe change"
```

Apply migration:

```bash
docker compose exec web flask db upgrade
```

Check migration status:

```bash
docker compose exec web flask db current
```

---

# Migration Notes

Do NOT run:

```bash
flask db init
```

again unless the `migrations/` folder does not exist.

Always commit migration files:

```bash
git add migrations
git commit -m "Add migration"
git push
```

---

# Docker Notes

Safe shutdown:

```bash
docker compose down
```

Dangerous command:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

The `-v` option deletes the PostgreSQL database volume and removes local database data.
