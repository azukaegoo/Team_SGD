# One Button App

A simple Flask-based web application .  
The app demonstrates a minimal full-stack setup where a single button click is stored in a PostgreSQL database.

The project is containerized using Docker and includes testing, CI integration, and a clean modular structure.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This application follows a standard Flask architecture using an application factory pattern.

When a user clicks a button on the homepage:
- A POST request is sent to the backend
- A database record is created
- A success or error message is displayed

This project demonstrates:
- Backend development with Flask
- Database integration with PostgreSQL
- Containerized development using Docker
- Testing and CI workflows

---

##  Features

- Single-button interaction (core functionality)
- Database persistence of button clicks
- Flash messages for feedback
- Docker-based environment setup
- Automated testing using `pytest`
- Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions

---

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Flask
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **ORM:** SQLAlchemy (Flask-SQLAlchemy)
- **Migrations:** Flask-Migrate
- **Testing:** pytest
- **Environment Variables:** python-dotenv
- **Containerization:** Docker & Docker Compose
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions

---

---

## How It Works

1. User opens the homepage
2. Clicks the **"Click Me"** button
3. A POST request is sent to the `/submit` route
4. Backend:
   - Creates a new database entry (`OneAppButton`)
   - Saves the timestamp
5. Result:
   - Success → confirmation message
   - Failure → rollback + error message

## 🧑‍💻 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone repository
cd Team_SGD
```
### 2. Setting environment variable
```bash
cp .env_sample .env
```
### 3. Run with Docker
```bash
docker compose up --build
```
### 4. Open Application
```bash
http://localhost:5000
```
### 5. Open another terminal and start tailwind in watch mode
Start Tailwind watch mode:

```bash
npx @tailwindcss/cli -i ./app/static/src/input.css -o ./app/static/css/output.css --watch
```

This automatically rebuilds CSS whenever changes are made.

---

## Opening the Project in Codespaces

1. Open the repository on GitHub
2. Click:

```text
Code → Codespaces → Create codespace on main
```

3. Wait for the dev container to finish configuring

The dev container automatically:

- installs Node.js
- installs npm packages
- starts Docker services
- forwards ports 5000 and 5432

---

## Project Stack

- Flask
- PostgreSQL
- Docker Compose
- Tailwind CSS
- GitHub Codespaces

---

## Starting the Application

After Codespaces finishes loading, start the containers:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

Check running containers:

```bash
docker ps
```

Expected containers:

```text
team_sgd-web-1
team_sgd-db-1
```

---

## Database Migration

Create a new migration:

```bash
docker compose exec web flask db migrate -m "message"
```

---

## Running Tailwind CSS

Start Tailwind watch mode:

```bash
npx @tailwindcss/cli -i ./app/static/src/input.css -o ./app/static/css/output.css --watch
```

This automatically rebuilds CSS whenever changes are made.

---

## Accessing the Application

Flask app:

```text
http://localhost:5000
```

PostgreSQL:

```text
localhost:5432
```

---

## Useful Docker Commands

Stop containers:

```bash
docker compose down
```

Restart containers:

```bash
docker compose restart
```

Rebuild containers:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

View logs:

```bash
docker compose logs
```

View web logs only:

```bash
docker compose logs web
```

---

# Recommended Workflow

## Frontend Development

```bash
npx @tailwindcss/cli -i ./app/static/src/input.css -o ./app/static/css/output.css --watch
```

---

# Important Notes

- Do NOT commit `.env`
- Do NOT commit `node_modules`
- Do NOT commit `__pycache__`
- Commit migration files after successful migrations

## Team Roles

#### Human Members
- Design system architecture
- Implement and integrate features
- Review and test all code before merging
- Manage GitHub branches and pull requests

#### AI Assistance
- Assists with debugging errors (e.g., Docker, database issues)
- Explains concepts when needed
- Suggests improvements or alternative implementations
- Help generate tests when needed

AI is used as a development assistant, while all final decisions remain with the team.


### Ensuring Correct Direction

To ensure the project stays aligned:

- The team agrees on architecture and design decisions before implementation

- GitHub is used for:
  - version control
  - pull requests
  - tracking changes

- Code reviews ensure consistency and correctness
- Testing (`pytest`) is used to validate functionality
